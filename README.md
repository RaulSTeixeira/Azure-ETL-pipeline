# Data Engineer Foundations: Azure Tokyo Olympics

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to create an ETL pipeline to first extract data from a datasource, then transform and aggregate the data so that analytics can be derived easily and finally load the transformed data into a SQL database.

This pipeline will use tools from Azure, including Data Factory, Databricks, Data Lake Storage Gen2 and Synapse Analytics. PowerBi might be added in the future, for visualizations.

To keep things simple I've added the source data to github, in csv format, from where Data Factory can connect and extract the necessary data.
